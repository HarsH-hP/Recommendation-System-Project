# Recommendation-System-Project

**Project Overview:**
- This project aims to develop a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that enhances user engagement by providing personalized movie suggestions tailored to individual tastes. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and natural language processing, the system analyzes user preferences alongside detailed movie features to recommend films.

**Objectives:**

- To implement a recommendation system that can accurately predict and suggest movies based on content similarities.
- To gain proficiency in handling and processing large datasets using Python and associated libraries.

**Methodology:**

  1) **Data Collection and Integration:**
      - Utilized two primary datasets, 'movies.csv' for general movie attributes and 'movies_credit.csv' for detailed cast and crew data.
      - Merged datasets on the 'title' attribute to unify all relevant data points for each movie.

  2) **Data Preprocessing:**
      - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and remove duplicates.
      - Simplified the datasets by extracting and focusing on key features necessary for content analysis such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

  3) **Feature Engineering:**
      - Transformed textual data into a structured format suitable for analysis, involving steps such as tokenization, removal of stopwords, and lemmatization.
      - Developed a unique identifier tag for each movie by concatenating important features into a single string, which serves as the basis for generating recommendations.

  4) **Model Development and Vectorization:**
      - Employed TfidfVectorizer to convert text data into TF-IDF vectors, facilitating the measurement of content similarity among movies.
      - Implemented cosine similarity to construct a similarity matrix that quantifies the closeness between movies based on their content features.

  5) **Recommendation Engine:**
      - Created a function to recommend movies based on the similarity scores derived from the TF-IDF vectors, providing users with the top 10 movie suggestions.
      - Demonstrated the system's effectiveness through sample predictions, which showcased the engine's ability to offer relevant recommendations based on content similarities.

  6) **Visualization and Analysis:**
      - Generated a word cloud to visualize the most frequently occurring words in the movie tags, providing insights into prevalent themes and topics within the dataset.


**Technologies Used:**

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
- NLTK for natural language processing.
- Plotly and WordCloud for data visualization.


**Results and Impact:**
- The Content-Based Movie Recommendation System effectively personalizes movie suggestions, significantly improving user experience by aligning recommendations with individual preferences.
